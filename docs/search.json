    "text": "I’m Ali Hamza Abidi, a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Texas A&M University, working under the guidance of Dr. Jonathan W. Siegel.\nMy research connects theoretical mathematics with machine learning, with a focus on approximation theory, optimization, and theoretical deep learning.\nMy work lies at the intersection of pure mathematics and artificial intelligence. I study how invariant neural networks, transformers, and graph neural networks approximate complex functions, explore sparsity-aware optimization methods for in-context learning and generalizability, and develop computational tools such as scikit-rom, an open-source Python library for reduced-order modeling of PDEs.\nI have maintained a 4.0 GPA in my doctoral program following a 3.99 GPA in my undergraduate studies at the University of Houston. My academic performance has been recognized through the Charles P. Benner Scholarship and multiple Academic Excellence Awards.\nBeyond research, I serve as a teaching assistant for calculus courses and conduct Python workshops. I am an active member of AMS, SIAM, and Pi Mu Epsilon, and a founding member of Cougar Mathletics and the Theology and Philosophy Academic Club.\nCurrently, I am preparing publications for venues such as JMLR and ICLR, with contributions on invariant learning and sharpness-aware optimization. My aim is to advance mathematical theory while keeping it practical and impactful for real-world applications.\nFluent in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Arabic, I bring a global perspective to collaborative research and believe that diversity strengthens scientific inquiry."
